              In 1726 Khan Abulkhair on behalf of the elders of the Younger zhuz applied to the Tsarist government with a request for submission.
              
              On October 10 (21), 1731, due to the weakening of the Kazakh Khanate during the grueling war with the Dzungars, Abulkhair and most of the elders of the Younger Juz swore allegiance to the Russian Empire, thus initiating the accession of Kazakhstan to Russia.</p>
